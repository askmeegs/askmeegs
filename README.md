### Hi! 

- I'm Megan. I'm a developer based in NYC. 🚕 
- Pronouns: they/them
- My job title is "Cloud Developer Advocate, Platform Evaluations" @ Google. I tinker with different Cloud platforms and tech stacks. The goal is to empathize with Cloud developers who often have to use [a lot of products](https://googlecloudcheatsheet.withgoogle.com/) at the same time, sometimes across more than one platform. ☁️
- Before this, I worked in Developer Relations Engineering for [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Istio](https://github.com/askmeegs/learn-istio). ☸️ 
- Before *that*, I was a Software Engineer building cloud/edge systems for Cisco. 🛠️
- Currently learning about: AI/ML (Tensorflow, natural language models) and hardware (Raspberry Pi/Arduino). 📚 
- In my spare time, I like to play music (🎸 🎻 🎹), write fiction 📖, and watch sci-fi films/TV 🪐.
