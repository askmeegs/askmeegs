### Hi! I'm Megan O'Keefe.

🌈 My pronouns are she/her. 

☁️ I'm a Developer Programs Engineer at Google Cloud. 

🏗 I work on platform infrastructure, and my job is to help make developers' lives easier + happier. 

 💻 In 2020, I am:
- Hearing from developers about the challenges of operating software infrastructure.
- Helping developers [learn about Service Mesh and Istio](https://github.com/askmeegs/learn-istio). 
- Building the Bank of Anthos [reference application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos) + [demos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos-scripts).

🌱 And I'm learning about: 
- Climate tech + sustainability.  
- Platform developer tools like Terraform and kustomize ☸️
