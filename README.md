## Hi! I'm Megan. 

‚ò∏Ô∏è I help developers build platforms with Kubernetes. My goal is to help people at every stage of the Kubernetes adoption process - from figuring out if they need K8s, to making it easier to work with YAML files, to building consistenty across multiple clusters.  

 **‚ú® Stuff I know about**: GKE, service mesh, Anthos. 

**üèó Currently building:** [Intro to KRM (demo)](https://github.com/askmeegs/intro-to-krm), [Bank of Anthos (sample app)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos), [OnlineBoutique (sample app](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)
