### Hi! I'm Megan O'Keefe.

🌈 My pronouns are she/her. 

☁️ I'm a Developer Programs Engineer at Google Cloud. 
🏗 I work on platform infrastructure, and my job is to help make developers' lives easier + happier. 

 💻 In 2020, I am:
- Understanding why developers run Kubernetes in hybrid and multicloud scenarios, and what kinds of tools could help. 
- Helping developers [learn about Service Mesh and Istio](https://github.com/askmeegs/learn-istio). 
- Building the Bank of Anthos [reference application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos) + [demos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos-scripts). 

🌱 And I am learning about: 
- Climate tech + sustainability.  
- On-prem use cases for machine learning. 
- bash, terraform, kustomize, and other platform-y tools!
