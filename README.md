### Hi! I'm Megan O'Keefe.

🌈 My pronouns are she/her. 

☁️ I'm a Developer Programs Engineer at Google Cloud. 

🏗 I work on infrastructure (Kubernetes, mostly) and my job is to help make platform developers' lives easier and happier.

 💻 Currently, I am: 
- Learning from enterprise developers about how software gets built in large organizations, and what kinds of platforms + tools enable that. 
- Building demos that show how developers can decouple dev and ops, accelerate the app development lifecycle, and optimize cloud resource costs.
- Helping platform developers [learn about service mesh](https://github.com/askmeegs/learn-istio) as a way to automate the network (and decouple dev + ops!) 
- Hacking on the Bank of Anthos [reference application](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos) + [demos](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bank-of-anthos-scripts).
